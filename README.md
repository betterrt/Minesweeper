# Minesweeper

## Objective
As we know, minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in various random locations in a two dimensional minefield. The player has to figure out where all the mines are without exploding a mine. They do this by repeatedly uncovering locations, and guessing mine locations, until they uncover all of the non-mine locations (win) or they explode a mine (lose).The objective is to write a program of game Minesweeper.

## Methods Used
1.Choosing the initial mine locations: Need to choose random mine locations at the beginning of a game.

2.Recursively finding an open area:  Need to use recursion to the solve the problem of finding an open area with no mines in it.
